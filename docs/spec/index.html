      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes the Ecdsa Secp256k1 Signature created in 2019 for the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset CANONICALIZATION Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-CANONICALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its canonical form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and ES256K JWS with Unencoded Payload Option defined in [[rfc7797]] as the <a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Linked Data Signature 2019
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a canonical form. This process is
sometimes also called CANONICALIZATION.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.

      </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A JSON-LD Document has been signed with EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019, 
            when it contains a proof field, and that proof field contains a jws, as 
            is defined by this spec.
          </dd>

          <dt><dfn>EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            A secp256k1 public key. If the key is embedded in a controller with property name publicKeyJwk, the key must be a valid JWK. If the key is embeded as publicKeyHex, it must be a compressed public key, and must be converted to JWK before being used to verify signatures according to JWS.

      <h2>Modification to Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
This signature suite uses ECDSA over secp256k1 as described in [[rfc6979]]. 
The signature algorithm relies on
JWK encoded keys, and this flexibility supports integration with JOSE.

The steps to construct and verify the digital signature are defined below.
      <p>

      <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined:
Signature Algorithm takes <var>tbs</var>, a <var>privateKey</var>,
and </var><var>options</var> as inputs and produces a
<var>signatureValue</var> as output.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take <var>tbs</var>, which is the data to be signed, an private key and options dictionary as input to the signature suite.
          </li>
          <li>
Perform the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-webauthn-algorithms-01#section-3.2">sign</a> digital signature algorithm specified of
[[rfc7797]] and return the result encoded as <em>jws</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>jws</em> will contain ".." per [[rfc7797]]:
            <code>WpQlDT-K5bSPQwFkEKszo0XE1esubvol3K6UMe_...</code>.
                      </li>
        </ol>

      </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Modifications to Signature Verification Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
The <var>digital signature algorithm</var> defined 
Signature Verification Algorithm takes the value to be verified,
<em>tbv</em>, the <em>public key</em> to the signature algorithm
and returns a boolean value.
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take <var>tbv</var> and perform the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797">Sign</a>
digital signature verification algorithm specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-webauthn-algorithms-01#section-3.2">ES26K JOSE DRAFT</a>. If the result is a valid signature, return
<code>true</code>, otherwise return <code>false</code>.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes security considerations that developers
implementing this specification should be aware of in order to create secure
software.
      </p>

<div class="issue">TODO: We need to add a complete list of security
considerations.</div>

<ol class="security_considerations">
  <li>
    This Signature Suite relies on the security and assumptions made by ECDSA over secp256k1. 
    We assume specifcally that sign and verify are implemented safely.
  </li>
